# Contributing to this library

This project uses [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). New features should be put in a `feature/` branch, so a pathfinding feature would be on the `feature/pathfinding` branch. New pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch.

## Documentation

This is a Java repository. Use Javadocs for all your new classes/methods. The goal is 100% coverage of all the code in this repository. Pull Requests not made to `develop` or lacking documentation will be marked invalid and closed.
